    "Python is considered to be a very flexible programming language, but that **doesn’t** mean that there are no controls to impose a set of functionalities or an order in a class hierarchy. When you develop a system in a group of programmers, it would be useful to have some means of establishing requirements for classes in matters of interfaces (methods) exposed by each class.\n",

    "- the class designer sets requirements regarding methods that must be implemented by just declaring them, but not defining them in detail. Such methods are called ***abstract methods***.\n",

This means that abstract classes are not limited to containing only abstract methods – some of the methods can already be defined, but if any of the methods is an abstract one, then the class becomes abstract.\n",
