    "### What is GUI?\n",
    "GUI is an acronym. Moreover, it’s a three-letter acronym, a representative of a well-known class of acronyms which plays a very important role in the IT industry. Okay, that’s enough jokes about TLA’s for one course, all the more that GUI is present nearly everywhere. Look around you – you’ll see a couple of different devices equipped with screens: phone, tablet, computer, TV set, fridge, oven, even washing machine or heating controller – all these things have a screen, most of them colored and many (more and more every year) use it to display a GUI and to communicate with the user. They communicate bidirectionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "GUI stands for **Graphical User Interface**. In this three-word acronym, the User seems to be the most obvious part. The word Interface needs some more reflection, but in fact, it is clear too – it’s a tool used by the user to command a device and to receive its responses.\n",

    "\n",
    "For a very long time (about 30 years or even longer) displays weren’t treated as a part of computers. A computer (sometimes called a mainframe) was a very big box (much, much bigger than the biggest refrigerator you ever had in your home) with thousands of colored lights, blinking all the time, and hundreds of switches (also colored).\n",
    "\n",
    "“Okay,” you may say, “nice image, but how could we control such a computer?”\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the computer, you needed to have a specialized and completely separate device called a terminal. The terminal needed to be wired to a computer (don’t forget that the Internet had not been invented yet) and was rarely placed in the same room. It could be placed in a different building, a different city or even on a different continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the most intriguing part of the story was that the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- was monochrome (it could display either grey, amber, or green dots on a black or nearly black background);\n",
    "- wasn’t able to display anything but letters, digits, and a few other characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter limitation is the most important as it dictated the way software was built for a very long time, almost an era in the history of IT technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it. Try to imagine what it was like to work with a computer without not being able to see a picture, not saying a word about movies or animations.\n",

    "A working GUI application externalizes its existence by creating a window (or windows) visible on the screen.\n",

    "In some environments (e.g., on mobile devices) the window can occupy the whole screen, so not more than one application can be visible on screen at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application's window is usually equipped with certain decorations: a title bar, a frame, buttons, icons, etc. As you probably know, the style in which the decorations are visualized and placed within the window may be treated as an operating system's birthmark. We're sure that you can distinguish different MS Windows versions just by looking at the colors and shapes visible on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operating environments completely disable a user's effect on the way in which the OS decorates application windows. Others don't – the user can define their own style and colors of virtually all the GUI elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some operating systems devote the whole screen to one application, so the decorations are extremely minimalistic or completely absent.\n",
