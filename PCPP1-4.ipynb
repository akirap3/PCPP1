No wonder, then, that they appear in JSON, as JavaScript derives from the C-language too. The similarity to Python dictionary syntax is unintentional.\n",

    "\n",
    "This doesn't mean that you have to use weird property names. We suggest you don’t do that at all. It only means that the property name's semantic isn't a part of the JSON standard. In other words, JSON is semantically blind when it comes to property names. It's none of its business how you name your properties.\n",
